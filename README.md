# GitHub-API-Helpers

Provide several (simple) tools to help the use of GitHub API. 

## Installation

Simply clone the repository. We strongly advice you to use a virtual environmnent, like *virtualenvwrapper* or *pew*. Inside your virtual environment, simply use PIP: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## decorators.py

This module provides decorators that are intented to be used with `requests.get`, `requests.post`, etc.

##### `prepend_url(prepended_url)` 
This decorator prepend the url given to `requests.get` by the value of `prepended_url`. Should be used after every other decorator. 

```python
consumer = decorators.prepend_url('https://api.github.com/')(requests.get)
```

##### `InMemoryCacheDecorator(cache=None)`
This decorator stores every call with an in-memory data structure (i.e. a dictionary) for subsequent calls. You may provide a non-empty dictionary to pre-populated the cache. Consult stderr to see if a cached value is retrieved.

```python
consumer = decorators.InMemoryCacheDecorator()(requests.post) 
```

##### `RedisBackendCacheDecorator(**kwargs)`
This decorator acts like `InMemoryCacheDecorator` but uses a Redis datastore. It relies on the ETag value of a requests to determine if a cached value has to be retrieved or if a new request has to be done, following this simple algorithm:
 - if the request concerns an unknown url, perform the request and store the results (only if `status_code == 200`). 
 - If the request concerns a known url, which exists in Redis, then retrieve the stored ETag for this url. A `If-None-Match` header is added to the request, with the corresponding ETag. If `status_code == 304`, it returns stored value. Otherwise, it updates the cache and returns the result. 

The constructor will pass every provided keyword argument to `redis.StrictRedis` (see `redis` module documentation). 

```python
consumer = decorators.RedisBackendCacheDecorator(host='10.102.170.77', db=5)(requests.get)
```
Consult stderr to see if a cached value is used, or if the cache is updated.
